# Tweets-Abuse-Classification
Out of many social media sites, Twitter has some unique characteristics which attract diverse categories of people. Twitter has been utilized as an important source of user-generated data that can provide unique insights into population. Many of these studies involve retrieving tweets for sentiment analysis, named entity recognition and disambiguation tasks.  In recent decades we have noticed a considerable increase in reports or confession posts of abuse victims on twitter. Most of the time victims do not report it to their guardians or the concerned authorities. Part of these victims tweet about their incident to let go of pain and suffering or as a cry for help. Identifying such reports is challenging.      We are providing a small scaled corpus on tweet reportings, you are required to build a machine learning model to classify the abuse tweets.
